<h2>Description</h2>
The Public Goods Game simulates a scenario where multiple groups contribute to a common pool with the goal of maximizing their collective benefit. Each group starts with a set number of points and decides how much to contribute each round. The total points pool is visible to everyone, and there is an additional reward system based on the total points each group holds. Rewards will be given to groups based on their point totals, and it is up to the users to determine the nature of these rewards (e.g., tangible items or other incentives). The game is designed to observe how the reward system influences group behavior and decision-making.

<h2>Rules of the Game</h2>

Setup:

- The game consists of 5 groups.
- Each group starts with a randomly allocated number of points, totaling 55 points across all groups.
<br />
<br />

Rounds:

- The game is played over 3 rounds.
- During each round, each group decides how many points to donate to the public pool from their current point total.
<br />
<br />

Donations:

- Each group selects a donation amount between 0 and their total points.
- The donated amount is subtracted from the groupâ€™s points.

<br />
<br/>

Redistribution:

- At the end of each round, the total donations from all groups are summed.
- The sum is then equally distributed among all groups.
<br />
<br />

Rewards:

- For every 10 points a group has at the end of the round (after redistribution), the group receives a reward, such as candies or other tangible items.
- The exact reward per 10 points should be specified before the game starts.
<br />
<br />

Total Points Pool:

- The total points pool, including initial points and rewards, is visible to all groups.
- This visibility helps groups make informed decisions about their donations.
<br />
<br />

Behavior Observation:

- The game is designed to observe how the reward system affects group behavior. Specifically, it aims to see if the reward system encourages more generous contributions or if groups will strategically manage their points to maximize rewards.
<br />
<br />
Progression:

- After redistribution and rewards, the game advances to the next round.
- The current round number and group points are updated accordingly.
<br />
<br />

End of Game:

- After 3 rounds, the game ends.
- The final points of each group are displayed.

Objective:

- The primary objective is to observe how the reward system influences individual and collective decisions. The goal is to analyze whether tangible rewards lead to increased contributions or change group dynamics.
<br />
<br />

Restart:

- Players can start a new game, resetting points and rounds to their initial states and playing again with different reward conditions or configurations to further explore the impact on behavior.
